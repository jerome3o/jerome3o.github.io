title: Advert Autonomy
---

We live in an age where the big tech is monopolising on our data, which it uses to advertise extremely well.

This is more than just making good targeted adds, it ends up being an exercise of categorising consumers into markets then auctioning off the advertising to that market to companies. I've heard the term "If it's free, then you are the product" many times, but it's only starting to dawn on me how profound the implications of that are.

I've been trying to wrap my head around the social implications of this, and it generally comes back to the saying "Do people make art, or does art make people?". When does the line between getting a targeted add because you'd like a certain product blur with you liking a product because you got a lot of targeted.

I find the implications of this interesting and could talk about it all day, and sometimes you can get a little bit doomer about it. However I had a thought, with this new world of advertising you have some new forms of autonomy, you can guide the algorithm. 

I've recently decided to start making changes in my life, one of those being conscious ethical consumption. And I decided instead of the usual suite of adds for a product like it's quality, price, looks, etc, I would like to be given information on how the product was produced. Does it prove that it's workers are given a living wage? what are the environmental impacts? Do they test on animals?


TODO 

Can I now purposefully stop and read adds on ethical consumption? Read news articles on ethical consumption (i.e. Tearfund reports), will this result in me more likely to be served up more adds. 

What accidental autonomy do we gain from this form of advertising?

Can we guide our targeted adds with a view to changing our behaviour?
