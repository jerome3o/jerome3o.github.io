 title: "JsonLLM: Getting Open Source LLMs to follow some rules"
 ---
 
+# Overview
+
+This is a bit of a long post, in it I go over:
+* My struggles with making LLM agents using open source models
+* Various ways force LLMs to output in a specific format
+* Open source projects for guiding LLMs with logit processing
+* My contribution: JsonSchema to Context Free Grammar compiler
+* Funny little bugs and learnings made along the way
+
 ## The Motivation
 
 I have become particularly interested in running private on-prem LLM agents, like a real sci-fi AI personal assistant. I want something that can do things like read my emails, edit my calendar, interact with my smart home, and maybe in the future plan whole events and buy things on my behalf. I wanted it to be all on prem, self hosted, so that all my data stays on-site. I think if AI is going to be running a large part of my life I'd like to know how it all works, and be running the majority of it myself.
