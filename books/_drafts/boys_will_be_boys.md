Reading this book was like waking up from a weird fever dream. Maybe that is just because this was the first piece of feminist literature that I've read, or perhaps it was quality of Clementine's writing. After reading Boys Will Be Boys I became accutely aware of the inequalities our society is saturated with, of which my awareness was previously only notional. 

I grew up in a relatively open minded family, where racial and gender equality were core tenets of my upbringing. But even from that cultural context I was taken aback by how prevailent the patriarchy is in our lives, and how well conventional wisdom and social norms could have continued to enable it's workings.

I read this book soon after learning about structuralism in a philosophy podcast, so I was somewhat primed to dig into my own cultural indoctrination. I was definitely shocked to be shown, in glaring detail, many of the behaviours and systems that I have been socialised to engage with and allow.

I see this realisation as a turning point in my life, as I cannot unlearn this social awareness, but I can learn more. I think everyone should read feminist literature before throwing any stones, and that conversations about privilege and oppression should be more common and accepted.

I am grateful to have read this book, and I am grateful for the conversations (and the people who've been open to said conversations) it has induced in my life, allowing me to take steps in working against my own unconcious training.
