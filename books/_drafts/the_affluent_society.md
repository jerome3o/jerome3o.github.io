This book was an awesome read for me, however it was doubly difficult as it's my first real dip into the world of economics, and it's one of the first books I've read from academia in the 1960s. It took a lot of google searches and vocabulary additions to get through, and I ended up fleshing out a lot of basic economic knowledge. So some things that I found insightful are probably basic economics, and as it was written in the 1960s it was cool to note what things had changed (seeming to be as a result of the knowledge explored in this book).

An interesting insight in how economists have viewed the world (especially up until the 1960s), and the impacts on society this has had. Galbraith coins the term "Conventional Wisdom" as the set of concepts and opinions of the current common knowledge in academia. He then goes on to show how his contemporary conventional wisdom was formed and how it was quickly becoming inaccurate. He is particularly focused on how the conventional wisdom is particularly invested in production, and most public opinion on public policy generally has concerns with how said policy will effect overall production.

He describes how in the time of Malthus, Ricardo, and Smith the most part of the population was impoverished and production was effectively the only thing pulling people out of starvation / material deprivation (producing food / water / shelter). And it was widely assumed that the masses would always be afflicted by some level of poverty. This explains the attitude of urgency around production.

However, as our society became more affluent, the additional wants/needs (in the context of privation) satisfied by production have become less urgent, however economists still regarded them all as equally urgent. Alongside that, there is massive growth of industry based on the creation of wants, such as advertising, which wasn't considered to be a significant factor in the creation of wants at the time of Galbraith's writing (they still believed in complete consumer sovereignty).

Galbraith highlights the store we put in production as a means for achieving economic security, and many other very beneficial aspects of production. But he starts to pull apart a lot of inconsistencies - such as the way we seemingly don't invest in things that would increase production like certain public goods (mainly education), technological advance, increasing efficiency. And he looks into attitudes on social policy regarding income insurance / benefits, and how one of our principle concerns are with the incentivization of non-productivity.

Notes on conventional wisdom:
* We naturally prefer ideas that are acceptable and familiar
* We reject those that devalue our investment
* This is evident in how content is acceptance tested
  * Such that being accepted is more important than being true
* It is only circumstance that forces us to change our ideas

1. Economics and the Tradition of Despair

* Galbraith defines "Central Tradition" to mean the main current of ideas in descent from Adam Smith
* This chapter is a brief history of Smith, Malthus, Ricardo
* Wealth from industrial revolution all went to the entrepreneurs
  * Workers still lived in awful conditions with subsistence wages
* The historic precedent was economic failure, economists were (and are) concerned about it.


As wealth became less visible in society people became less adverse to economic inequality. 

Focus shifted from income redistribution to increased productivity

1. Economic Security

Production as a means to obtaining economic security. Ensuring production and consumption over depressions / recessions ensures economic stability. This can be achieved by things like employment insurance / benefits as in periods of unemployment people can still consume.

9. The paramount position of production

We are not actually rationally interested in actively increasing production. This can be observed by the absence of investment in the things that increase production in several industries. We take production as a measure of our achievement but we do actively strive to achieve.

Our motivations to increase production is odd. We are over worried about idleness and bad resource allocation which were more relevant in previous centuries. 

Little is done in peace time to increase capital formation.

Little is invested in technological improvementswhere large increase in output are to be expected. 

We aren't worried about the production loses in depression, we are far more concerned with economic stability.

We value public goods much less than private production (advertising?). Associated to a long history of bad kings / feudal, public spending associated to socialism. Even though the desire for public goods are high.

Maybe we aren't concerned with production because it's actually not that important. 

"We have become persuaded of the dire importance of the goods we have, without our being in the slightest degree concerned about those we do not have. For we have wants at the margin only so far as they are synthesized. We do not manufacture the wants for good we do not produce"
