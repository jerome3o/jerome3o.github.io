title: The Affluent Society
---


1. The Affluent Society

* The world was formed in privation of the masses
* Economic thought and the central tradition assumed poverty was necessary
* The affluent society needs to learn to understand itself else the affluence will go

2. Conventional Wisdom

* We naturally prefer ideas that are acceptable and familiar
* We reject those that devalue our investment
* This is evident in how content is acceptance tested
  * Such that being accepted is more important than being true
* It is only the never ending stream of events in life that forces us to change our ideas
* Galbraith coins the current dogmatic thought "Conventional Wisdom"

3. Economics and the Tradition of Despair

* Galbraith says Central Tradition to mean the main current of ideas in descent from Adam Smith
* This chapter is a brief history of Smith, Malthus, Ricardo
* Wealth from industrial revolution all went to the entrepreneurs
  * Workers still lived in awful conditions with subsistence wages
* The historic precedent was economic failure, economists were (and are) concerned about it.
* It outlines the logic behind necessary deprivation of the masses
  * Smith
    * Was optimistic that economic progress would occur
    * He didn't think life was going to improve for the working masses
  * Malthus
  * Ricardo

4. The Uncertain Reassurance


5. The American Mood

* All about the central tradition
* Extreme affluence
* Social Darwinism
  * Survival of the fittest was coined by Herbert Spencer, not Charles Darwin.
