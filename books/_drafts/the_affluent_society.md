title: The Affluent Society
---


1. The Affluent Society

* The world was formed in privation of the masses
* Economic thought and the central tradition assumed poverty was necessary
* The affluent society needs to learn to understand itself else the affluence will go

2. Conventional Wisdom

* We naturally prefer ideas that are acceptable and familiar
* We reject those that devalue our investment
* This is evident in how content is acceptance tested
  * Such that being accepted is more important than being true
* It is only the never ending stream of events in life that forces us to change our ideas
* Galbraith coins the current dogmatic thought "Conventional Wisdom"

3. Economics and the Tradition of Despair

* Galbraith says Central Tradition to mean the main current of ideas in descent from Adam Smith
* This chapter is a brief history of Smith, Malthus, Ricardo
* Wealth from industrial revolution all went to the entrepreneurs
  * Workers still lived in awful conditions with subsistence wages
* The historic precedent was economic failure, economists were (and are) concerned about it.
* It outlines the logic behind necessary deprivation of the masses
  * Smith
    * Was optimistic that economic progress would occur
    * He didn't think life was going to improve for the working masses
  * Malthus
  * Ricardo

4. The Uncertain Reassurance


5. The American Mood

* All about the central tradition
* Extreme affluence
* Social Darwinism
  * Survival of the fittest was coined by Herbert Spencer, not Charles Darwin.

6. The Marxian Pall

7. Inequality

As wealth became less visible in society people became less adverse to economic inequality. 

Focus shifted from income redistribution to increased productivity

8. Economic Security

Production as a means to obtaining economic security. Ensuring production and consumption over depressions / recessions ensures economic stability. This can be achieved by things like employment insurance / benefits as in periods of unemployment people can still consume.

9. The paramount position of production

We are not actually rationally interested in actively increasing production. This can be observed by the absence of investment in the things that increase production in several industries. We take production as a measure of our achievement but we do actively strive to achieve.

Our motivations to increase production is odd. We are over worried about idleness and bad resource allocation which were more relevant in previous centuries. 

Little is done in peace time to increase capital formation.

Little is invested in technological improvementswhere large increase in output are to be expected. 

We aren't worried about the production loses in depression, we are far more concerned with economic stability.

We value public goods much less than private production (advertising?). Associated to a long history of bad kings / feudal, public spending associated to socialism. Even though the desire for public goods are high.

Maybe we aren't concerned with production because it's actually not that important. 

"We have become persuaded of the dire importance of the goods we have, without our being in the slightest degree concerned about those we do not have. For we have wants at the margin only so far as they are synthesized. We do not manufacture the wants for good we do not produce"
