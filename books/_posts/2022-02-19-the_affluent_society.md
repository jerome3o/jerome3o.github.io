This book was an awesome read for me, however it was doubly difficult as it's my first real dip into the world of economics, and it's one of the first books I've read from academia in the 1960s. It took a lot of google searches and vocabulary additions to get through, and I ended up fleshing out a lot of basic economic knowledge. So some things that I found insightful are probably basic economics, and as it was written in the 1960s it was cool to note what things had changed (seeming to be as a result of the knowledge explored in this book).

An interesting insight in how economists have viewed the world (especially up until the 1960s), and the impacts on society this has had. Galbraith coins the term "Conventional Wisdom" as the set of concepts and opinions of the current common knowledge in academia. He then goes on to show how his contemporary conventional wisdom was formed and how it was quickly becoming inaccurate. He is particularly focused on how the conventional wisdom is particularly invested in production, and most public opinion on public policy generally has concerns with how said policy will effect overall production.

He describes how in the time of Malthus, Ricardo, and Smith the most part of the population was impoverished and production was effectively the only thing pulling people out of starvation / material deprivation (producing food / water / shelter). And it was widely assumed that the masses would always be afflicted by some level of poverty. This explains the attitude of urgency around production.

However, as our society became more affluent, the additional wants/needs (in the context of privation) satisfied by production have become less urgent, however economists still regarded them all as equally urgent. Alongside that, there is massive growth of industry based on the creation of wants, such as advertising, which wasn't considered to be a significant factor in the creation of wants at the time of Galbraith's writing (they still believed in complete consumer sovereignty).

Galbraith highlights the store we put in production as a means for achieving economic security, and many other very beneficial aspects of production. But he starts to pull apart a lot of inconsistencies - such as the way we (as a society at large) seemingly don't invest in things that would increase production like certain public goods (mainly education), technological advance, increasing efficiency. And he looks into attitudes on social policy regarding income insurance / benefits, and how one of our principle concerns are with the incentivization of non-productivity.

He then focuses on his argument that the conventional wisdom tends to value high private production as a measure of a good economy, but to denigrate spending on public goods. Resulting in the implicit notion that consumer expenditure on personal goods and services is valued above government expenditure on public goods funded by taxes. He then coins the term "Social Balance" as the ratio of public to private expenditure. He argues that as our society becomes more affluent a better social balance is integral, as it depends on state provided goods and services like law enforcement, education, clean streets, public transport, infrastructure, and regulations. He also states that all of these things are required for a thriving private sector and economic growth, especially education. He notes that these things cannot feasibly be provided by private business / corporations in a way that is beneficial to the general public.

Galbraith then argues that now we are aware of the errors in the conventional wisdom we can make beneficial changes to society. Two key points he raises are:
* More unemployment benefits 
  * Focusing on employment is not the the best way to cure economic downturns/high inflation
  * Unemployment will be required to build a world that doesn't have production as a central focus
* Increased Sales Tax (GST)
  * Sales tax grows with production and consumption more so than income tax
  * This would allow proportional funding for public goods

Interesting notes on conventional wisdom:
* Humans naturally prefer ideas that are acceptable and familiar
* We reject those that devalue our investments (personal education/skills specifically)
* This is evident in how content is acceptance tested
  * Such that being accepted is more important than being true
* It is only circumstance that forces us to change our ideas
