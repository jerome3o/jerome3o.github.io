### High level summary

A book tackling some a big question posed to Jared Diamond by his friend Yali, from Papua New Guinea (paraphrased):

> "Why did Europeans colonise Papua New Guinea, and not the other way around?"

Guns Germs and Steel crosses many scientific fields (ecology, evolutionary biology, linguistics, history, geology, and more) to provide ultimate answers explaining the inequalities in our current world caused by colonialism. The book is concise, coherent, and interesting. It gave me some good foundational knowledge useful for understanding of the broad strokes of human history, and a framework for seeking ultimate answers, as opposed to proximate ones.

The book identifies some of the proximate factors that cause one type of society to out-compete another, such as (as the title infers):
* Technology
  * Advanced tools (i.e. steel/metallurgy)
  * Weapons
  * Written language
  * Navigation
* Germs
  * Immunity epidemic diseases like smallpox and the bubonic plague
* Population and political organisation
  * States
  * Specialists
  * Armies

The book highlights how these proximate causes are all contingent on having intensive agriculture, and thus a consistent food surplus, high population density, and large non-food producing portion of the population. It then looks into the ultimate causes that enable food production:

* Availability of domesticable plants
* Availability of large domesticable mammals for:
  * Reliable protein source
  * Power / labour (plowing fields, moving goods)
* Ease of the spread of agriculture
  * East-west vs north south major axes of landmasses
    * Meaning the Eurasian domesticates from the Fertile Crescent could spread much further and faster than those of early America (due to climatic variation rendering crops infeasible)
* Idea Diffusion
  * Societies are generally much more likely to adopt ideas/technology than invent it endemically
  * Thus connections / trade routes are very beneficial, which are generally enabled or prevented by geography

### Interesting notes

A very small selection of interesting things explored in the book.

#### Evolution of Germs

An interesting observation made in the book is that germ evolution was not only contingent on high human population density, but also sharing that density with cattle / herd animals. Epidemic viruses require large amounts of their host in high density, this is generally not the case for hunter gatherer societies, but throughout evolutionary history it much more fit for herd animals. 

Thus the development of high intensity animal agriculture (i.e. that of cattle / sheep) was a massive influence the development of human epidemic viruses. The fact that the Americas (and other recently colonised landmasses) did not have such domesticable mammals available endemically and Eurasia did, can explain the unequal immunity and development of germs which were instrumental in wars / colonisation.

#### Natural experiments

This book highlights the value of "Natural Experiments" for fields of historic science (i.e. astronomy, ecology, evolutionary biology, etc) where it is unethical or infeasible to conduct planned experiments. A natural experiment is a naturally occurring set of circumstances that is like that of a useful planned experiment, and thus can be used to make meaningful inferences.

The second chapter of the book makes inferences on what types of societies form given different environmental conditions by treating the polynesian island societies as a natural experiment. After the Austronesian expansion that resulted in the colonisation of all inhabitable pacific islands (starting with south chinese expanding into Taiwan in 3500 B.C. and ending with the Chatham Islands in 1300 A.D.) many isolated societies formed from a common ancestral society, and many differences between these societies can be correlated to environmental conditions. Some of the environmental conditions explored were: island climate, geological type, marine resources, area, terrain fragmentation, and isolation. Societal features looked into were things like population density, agriculture, social stratification, political unity, economic/political/social organisation, and material culture. I won't go into the details here as the chapter is already concise and coherent.

#### Early crop domestication

An interesting idea explored by Jared is how early plant domestication was likely unconscious. Humans produced a natural selection pressure on the plants that they could eat, and those plants proliferated from human latrines. It wasn't till sufficient natural evolution occurred before humans were able to consciously domesticate and induce new artificial selection pressures on previously wild crops.

#### Animal Domestication

Many things need to line up for animals to be domesticated, and large domesticated mammals are immensely useful for agricultural societies. Until reading this book I didn't realise how many moving parts there are to domesticating an animal, and how lucky Eurasia was to have so many candidates that ticked all the boxes.

Examples of pre-requisites for domestication:
* Growth Rate
* Breeding in captivity
* Disposition and tendency to panic
* Social structure (to allow humans to be imprinted as leaders)

Without all of these things being in favour of domestication even modern peoples cannot domesticate an animal in a productive way.

#### Inventions

The book identifies some common notions around technological innovation as fallacy or misconception. 

* Misconception: Technological advances are predicate on individual genius'
  * Technological innovations don't occur in a vacuum, and are generally a product of inter-generational collaboration, despite being remembered throughout history as disproportionate contributions of a select few. I.e. the steam engine being invented by James Watt - he did contribute massively to the modern designs, but his work was founded on earlier designs from many others.
* Misconception: New technology arises from a societal need
  * Sometimes true (Manhattan project for example), but generally not the case. Usually inventors will make something that generally society doesn't need, or inventions for one problem become solutions for something completely different. Examples:
    * Thomas Edison's phonograph was invented for office use, but was later co-opted to his distaste as the means for making juke boxes and proliferating popular music.
    * The internal combustion engine, initially made in a time where society was completely content with horses and railroads. It wasn't until World War 1 (about 50 years later) that they were used, and then took 50 years of lobbying to convince the public to change over from horse driven transport.

#### World History

The last quarter of the book was brief overviews of the history of different sections of the world: Africa, Papua New Guinea, Polynesia, Japan, China, America and Eurasia. In these sections Jared describes how his explanatory framework of societal development played out in those regions. I ended up learning a tonne and sparking an interest in world history.
