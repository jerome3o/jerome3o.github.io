Reading this book was like waking up from a weird fever dream. Maybe that is just because this was the first piece of feminist literature that I've read, or perhaps it was quality of Clementine's writing. After reading Boys Will Be Boys I became acutely aware of the inequalities our society is saturated with, of which my awareness was previously only notional. 

I grew up in a relatively open minded family, where racial and gender equality were core tenets of my upbringing. But even from that cultural context I was taken aback by how prevalent the patriarchy is in our lives, and how well conventional wisdom and social norms could have continued to enable it's workings in my life.

I read this book soon after learning about structuralism in a philosophy podcast, so I was somewhat primed to dig into my own cultural indoctrination. I was definitely shocked to be shown, in glaring detail, many of the behaviours and systems that I have been socialised to engage with and allow.

I see this realisation as a turning point in my life, as I cannot unlearn this social awareness, but I can learn more. I think everyone should read feminist literature before throwing any stones, and that conversations about privilege and oppression should be more common and accepted.

I am grateful to have read this book, and I am grateful for the conversations (and the people who've been open to said conversations) it has induced in my life, allowing me to take steps in working against my own unconscious training.

### Some key points for memory

This is a partial recollection of points from the book for the sake of my memory (I don't have the book on hand to skim through while writing as I've lent it out to everyone who'll take it).

* Patriarchal Indoctrination
  * Gendered clothing (obvious example)
    * Girls clothes have historically focused on aesthetics, boys on character and ability.
    * The child can't read what's on their clothes, but every adult they interact with can
      * This unconsciously tells the adult how to behave around the child, and trains the child what to expect from social interactions throughout their life.
  * Representation in Movies
    * The book lays out some dire statistics on the representation of women and ethnic minorities in film
    * This teaches young girls that they are not the protagonist, and are usually consigned to a support role in life.
      * I see film as one of the front lines of cultural movements, and it fills my heart to know my [sister](https://www.niamhswannack.com/) is dedicating her life to creating all-inclusive spaces behind and in-front of the camera.
* Toxic Masculinity
  * Throughout a boy's life it is implicit (if not explicit) that they should not express non-"masculine" emotions.
    * This fundamentally prohibits a man from feeling comfortable experiencing large parts of the human experience.
    * There needs to be room for the full range of emotion in masculinity, as it is required for emotional maturity.
* Rape Culture
  * Jokes about sex
    * The ability to laugh at a lot of jokes about sex comes from a position of privilege, as sexual assault is generally not something men have ever had to be afraid of in their lives
    * Any sexual joke at the expense of women simply reinforces the (sometimes unwitting) proponents of rape culture.
  * Public perception and discourse around sexual assault
    * Victim blaming is still prolific in public debate regarding sexual assault.
    * Rapists are real people, not some weird made up evil character that lurks in the shadows.
      * Around 1/8 women will be victims of sexual assault in their lives.
      * It's most likely a friend or family member that will commit the crime.
    * The notion that woman use sexual assault cases as a means of ruining a mans career is debunked in the final chapter of the book where clementine lists about 50 famous men accused of sexual assault, who's careers are doing just fine.
* Domestic Labour
  * Societal expectation that women should disproportionately contribute to do mestic labour is prolific and fundamentally unfair
  * Commonly accepted notion of men "helping out" with chores is an example of how distorted this social norm is.

I could write a lot more here, but you should just read the book.
