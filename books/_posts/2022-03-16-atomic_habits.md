You are what you continually do.

Excellence is not an act, it's a habit.

I sound like my old high school principal, I didn't like him very much, but he was right.

The book Atomic Habits by James Clear contains a quick description of the human psychology around habit formation, and then a full fledged guide on how to exploit the inner workings of your brain to your advantage, whether that be success in your career, your family life, or in your hobbies.

Another theme that is interesting throughout the book is the frequent examples of how habit formation and the associated psychology is used by businesses to gain and keep your patronage, generally focusing on the private food industry and big tech.

### Habit cycle

### Cool Lessons
#### Heroin addiction of returning Vietnam soldiers

Of the returning soldiers who formed a heroin addiction while at war, only 13% relapse on return home. Whereas people who get clean in rehab, but return to the environment in which they formed the addiction are 90% likely to relapse.

Lessons:
* The environment in which a habit is formed is naturally conducive to performing that habit. 
* You can change your habits easier by changing your environment. 
* Those with the most will power need to use it the least.

#### Hyper Stimuli
