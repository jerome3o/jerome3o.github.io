# Using a Cerambots 3D printer to turn blender designs into pottery

* Cerambots 3D
* Link to Kieran's repo (might need to put it on github)

## Process

* Setup description
* Design in Blender
* Render in Cura
* MicroSD to printer
* Monitor printing
* Let dry on cardboard
* Bisque fire
* Glaze
* Fire

## Clay prep

* Adding water
* Mixing to the consistency of mud
* Filling the ram extruder
  * Goal is to minimise air pockets, to avoid popping at the final extrusion 
  * Compactly fill a tall container with the slushy clay
  * Push the ram extruder upside down into the clay, filling it up to the small outlet
  * This prevents most air bubbles and take the least amount of time

## Printer Setup

TODO: link kieran's repo

## Clean up

We don't want dry clay clogging up all the parts, so after each session we thoroughly washed down all parts that touched clay

## Design limitations

* Can't have any over-hanging parts or the clay will slump
* The larger can get quite unstable as the clay is very soft, so making sure the design is well stacked vertically is a must

## Next steps

* Streamline the process
* Expertiment with glazes
* Try and get the outputs water tight
