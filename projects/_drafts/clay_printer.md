# The Intersection of Computer Science and Pottery

I have recently been interested in finding projects that link pottery and computer science together. My mother is a visual artist who has spent a large portion of her life working with clay, and I have spent a large part of my life playing with and working on computers, currently working as a software developer.

I feel that we both exsert a lot of creativity in our respective fields, but it is quite hard to bridge the two in a common language. 

Mum recently started working with clay 3D printers as part of personal career growth in her capacity as a lab technician at [AUT](https://www.aut.ac.nz/), and had the opportunity to lend my flatmate and I a 3D printer for a few weeks to play around with. This blog post outlines the process of using the 3D printer to turn a design in Blender into a piece of pottery, and all the little issues along the way. But it also signifies the start of an interest in finding ways to combine the field of ceramics with computer science (tentative name for the project "Throwing Exceptions").

All of the technical work with the 3D printer was done in collaboration with [Kieran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kieran-hitchcock/), and all the glazing and firing was done in collaboration with my mother, in her pottery studio.

# Overview

I'll give an overview of the making process from design in blender to firing the finished product in a kiln, and then I'll give a summary of all the interesting hiccups, happy accidents, and learnings we had along the way.

# Process

## Design and rendering

* Design in Blender
* Render in Cura
* MicroSD to printer

### A note on design limitations

* Can't have any over-hanging parts or the clay will slump
* The larger can get quite unstable as the clay is very soft, so making sure the design is well stacked vertically is a must

## Printer setup

* Clay prep
  * Adding water
  * Mixing to the consistency of mud
  * Filling the ram extruder
    * Goal is to minimise air pockets, to avoid popping at the final extrusion 
    * Compactly fill a tall container with the slushy clay
    * Push the ram extruder upside down into the clay, filling it up to the small outlet
    * This prevents most air bubbles and take the least amount of time
* Monitor printing
* Let dry on cardboard

## Pottery

* Bisque fire
* Glaze
* Fire


# Happy Accidents and Learnings

# Next steps

* Streamline the process
* Expertiment with glazes
* Try and get the outputs water tight
