title: "Throwing Exceptions: Two Byte Bowls"
---

# Intro

* Reference to previous post with the 3d printer, didn't explore the glazing
* Information theory in the glazing?
* All text on a computer (and anything else really) is encoded with a binary representation (i.e. as 1s and 0s)
* For example `A` is encoded as `01000001`
* In this project I encode the initials of my friends and family in binary, and paint that binary as lines on some bowls
* Kind of like a very artisanal barcode
* I could only fit two bytes of information (two english characters), thus the name "Two Byte Bowls"

# How they're made

* Lump of clay
* Kneaded
* Thrown on the wheel
* Turned
* Glazed
* Fired

# Would this be something you're interested in?

Thinking of making it a side hussle
