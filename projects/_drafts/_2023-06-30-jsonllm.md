title: "JsonLLM: Getting Open Source LLMs to follow some rules"
---

Over the last few months I've been making putting a lot of time into learning about machine learning, LLMs in particular, for economic and personal reasons. I've become extremely interested in getting a decent language model running on prem as a home assistant of sorts, automating complicated tasks while keeping all of my data on prem. I think if AI is going to be running a large part of my life I'd like to know how it all works, and be running the majority of it myself. 

* Been learning about LLMs, trying to make some agents
* I want it to be all on prem, self hosted, all my data stays on-site
* Open source LLMs are decent for many things
    * But ensuring that it produces valid arguments for a python function is hard
* Little calendar example?
* Description of how LLMs work, token generation etc
* Prior art of token masking (ReLLM, ParserLLM, jsonformer)
* Discussion of jsonllm
    * Converts jsonschema into cfg
    * Uses lark to make a parser
    * Hands that over to ParserLLM
    * Which breaks it down into regular expressions and leverages ReLLM.
* Link to code and some examples (with a nice pydantic code snippet)
