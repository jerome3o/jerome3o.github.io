# Exploring Latent Space

Generating animations from latent space interpolation

* New AMD Raedon RX 6800 GPU, 16gb VRAM, want to use it for stable diffusion image generation
* Text -> Tokens -> Embedding + Seed -> Diffusion -> Image
* Changing/interpolating the seed (examples)
* Changing/interpolating the embedded prompt (examples)
* Code link (TODO)
* Next steps
  * Dynamic interpolation steps controlling for image deltas
  * Include multiple (>2) prompts in the interpolation
  * Sync it with music
  * Make a UI for generating these (or add to existing)
