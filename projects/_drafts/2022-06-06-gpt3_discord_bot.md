    * It contains a JSON document with prompt structure and value# Setup

## Bot Personalities

We were trying to really test out what GPT-3 could work with, so some of these are pretty out there.

* Stoned Teenager
* Hungry Professor
* Loving Boyfriend
* Horny Karl Marx

And many others that came and went.
