title: Boids in WASM
---

The goal for this project was to try out [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org/) (WASM). Having recently learnt a bit of [golang](https://go.dev/) for work and out of personal interest I decided a good foray into WASM would be to make a quick write up of boids in golang, compile it to WASM, and render the boids using javascript (I went with the [p5js](https://p5js.org/) framework for the animation).
