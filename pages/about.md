I'm Jerome.

I'm currently working as a software developer, and am super interested in philosophy, learning, hiking, making music, reading books, and getting lost in (sometimes silly) software projects.

I've recently become more consciously interested in how humankind is transitioning online, and how that is effecting the way we interact, structure society, and express ourselves. Being in one of the first generations to grow up with the internet, this has always been a backdrop to my life, but as I learn and read more I'm starting to grasp the profundity of this transition.

This website/blog/thing symbolises the start of my journey to learning how to use my skills as a software minded person to (somewhat skeuomorphically) create/document my own art and projects, with a focus on self expression, as opposed to productivity.

This site is some weird mishmash of a journal, portfolio, and art project.
