I'm Jerome.

I'm currently working as a software developer, and am super interested in philosophy, learning, hiking, making music, 
reading books, and getting lost in (sometimes silly) software projects.

I've recently become super interested in how humankind is transitioning online, and how that effects the way we 
interact, structure society, and express ourselves. 

This website/blog/thing symbolises the start of my journey to 
learning how to use my skills as a software minded person to (somewhat skeuomorphically) create/document my own art and 
projects, with a focus on self expression, as opposed to productivity (In such a way that I maintain ownership of my own 
data).

This site is some weird mishmash of a journal, portfolio, and art project.
