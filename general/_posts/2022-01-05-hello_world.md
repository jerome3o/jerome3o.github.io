The first post.

At the time of writing I am a 26 year old male from Auckland, New Zealand. 

Over the course of the last 4 years I have been slowly learning how to remove (or significantly reduce) the amount of my spare time spent on information age luxuries such as endless feeds, auto-playing youtube videos, and online gaming, and learning how to direct my notoriously obsessive personality toward something more beneficial.

Being part of the efficiency and productivity focused world we live in, the default direction of that effort was to try and achieve better employment prospects, by invoking a passion for software. I was able to achieve this goal by curating my feeds and dedicating more time to learning software. At the time of starting these changes I was working at [Veriphi](https://www.veriphi.co.nz/) as a Research and Development engineer, I then moved over to [Rocket Lab](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/) as a Loads and Environments Analyst (learning how vibration and other physical environments break rockets), then moved into a purely software role of Operational Data Software Engineer (making tools to understand rocket performance), of which is giving me great challenge and job satisfaction.

For the most part I am happy with the skills and knowledge I have accumulated regarding software development, I believe I have stoked the fires of a life long passion, and that I will find joy in the work I do (contingent on it being beneficial for society). But after a side quest through philosopy (namely the [Philosophize This!](https://www.philosophizethis.org/) podcast) I became interested in discovering ways in which I could use my skillset for normally non "productive" things. This includes art, different modes of communication, and self expression. This website is in part a documentation of this journey of learning, but also a manifestation of it.

This may seem a bit philosophical for a static site which outlines a bunch of projects I've worked on. But it's me realising the importance of spending time learning how to do things for fun, and not for productivity. This is me exploring those thoughts.
